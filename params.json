This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.\r\n* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself in another branch so I can ignore when I pull)\r\n* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\n    $ gem install bundler (if you don't have it)\r\n\r\n    $ bundle install\r\n    $ bundle exec rake\r\n\r\n    $ gem install bundler (if you don't have it)\r\n\r\n    $ bundle install\r\n    $ bundle exec rake\r\n\r\n## Problems or Questions?\r\n\r\nHit up the google group:\r\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/mongomapper\r\n\r\nHop on IRC:\r\nirc://chat.freenode.net/#mongomapper\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nSee LICENSE for details.","google":"","tagline":"My Campfire Propane style"}
